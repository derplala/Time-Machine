Monday, March 5th

Done:
o Discussed how our eventual design would look. We have a general idea of it, but we will be largely dependent of the parts that
  will available. Therefore, we decided to meet on Friday 9th to go shopping for parts.
o Made sketches of our eventual design (see attached files).
o Lisa put Ricky and Monica to a programming assignment.
